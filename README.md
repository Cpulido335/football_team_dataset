This is a basic dataset taken from a college football team.

FORMAT SECTION 
number: Players jersey number
name: Players full name
position: Players position group, shorthand (Ex. RB = Running Back)
class: Players academic year, shorthand (Ex. Jr = Junior year of college)
height: Players height, American standard notation

Note to self: I trust this data to be accurate because I have collected it myself and it is highly reflective of a college football team
